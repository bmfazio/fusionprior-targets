# Simulation testing of priors for effect fusion
We seek to implement an effect fusion prior based on the horseshoe prior from Piironen (2017), using concepts proposed in Pauger (2019).

**Pending**

* Implement a fusion-inducing version of the horseshoe prior

**Complete**

* Replicate the toy simulation done in section 4.1.1 of Piironen (2017)
* Replicate the simulation done in section 5.2 of Pauger (2019)
